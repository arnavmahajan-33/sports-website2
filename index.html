                <h1>Biography :</h1>
                <p>
                    Roger Federer was born on 8 August 1981 in Basel, Switzerland. His Swiss father, Robert Federer, is
                    from Berneck in the Canton of St. Gallen, and his Afrikaner mother, Lynette Federer (née Durand), is
                    from
                    Kempton Park, Gauteng, in South Africa. He has one sibling, his older sister, Diana, who is the
                    mother of a
                    set of twins. Since Federer’s mother is South African, he holds both Swiss and South African
                    citizenship.
                    He grew up in nearby Birsfelden, Riehen, and then Münchenstein, close to the French and German
                    borders, and
                    he speaks Swiss German, Standard German, English, and French fluently, as well as functional Italian
                    and Swedish; Swiss German is his native language. Federer served as a ball boy at his hometown Basel
                    tournament, the Swiss Indoors, in 1992 and 1993.
                    <br><br>
                    Like all male Swiss citizens, Federer was subject to compulsory military service in the Swiss Armed
                    Forces. However, in 2003 he was ruled "unsuitable" and was subsequently not required to fulfill his
                    military
                    obligation. Instead, he served in the civil protection force and was required to pay 3% of his
                    taxable income as an alternative. He grew up supporting FC Basel and the Swiss national football
                    team.
                    Federer also credits his hand-eye coordination to the wide range of sports he played as a child,
                    including badminton and basketball.
                    <br><br>
                    Federer is married to former Women's Tennis Association player Miroslava Federer (née Vavrinec),
                    whom he met while they were both competing for Switzerland at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Usually
                    called Mirka, she retired from the tour in 2002 because of a foot injury. They were married at
                    Wenkenhof Villa in
                    Riehen near Basel on 11 April 2009, surrounded by a small group of close friends and family. In
                    2009, Mirka gave birth to identical twin girls. The Federers had another pair of identical twins in
                    2014, this time boys.

                <h1>Achievements :</h1>
                <p>
                    Federer and Rafael Nadal have won more Grand Slam tournament titles (20) than any other men's
                    singles players. He is the first men's singles player to have reached ten consecutive
                    Grand Slam tournament finals and a total of 31 Grand Slam finals. He has earned a men's
                    doubles gold medal, and a men's single silver medal at the Olympics in 2008 and 2012,
                    respectively. He has spent the second-most time at the top of the ATP Rankings (310 weeks). He
                    also holds the record for the most titles (6) at the year-end tournament, where only the year-end
                    eight highest-ranked players participate. Federer was ranked among the top eight players in the
                    world continuously for 14 years and two weeks—from 14 October 2002 until 31 October 2016, when
                    injuries forced him to skip much of the 2016 season.
                    <br><br>
                    Federer has won the ATP Player of the Year five times (2004–07, 2009), and has become ITF World
                    Champion five times (2004–07, 2009). He has won the ATPWorldTour.com Fans' Favourite Award a record
                    18 times consecutively (2003–20), and has won the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award (voted for by
                    the players) a record 13 times (2004–09, 2011–17),[348] both being awards indicative of respect and
                    popularity. He also won the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year Award twice (2006, 2013), the
                    Laureus World Sportsman of the Year five times (2005–08, 2018), and the Laureus World Comeback of
                    the Year once, following his 2017 renaissance.
